TITLE:: RTWaveSetPlayerTriggered
summary:: Play wavesets on trigger.
categories:: UGens>Unclassified
related:: Classes/RTWaveSetAnalysis, Classes/RTWaveSetSelector

DESCRIPTION::
Use the results of a RTWaveSetAnalysis UGen to play a group of wavesets on trigger. It's possible to spawn a new parallel playback by trigger while others are still playing (currently there is a fixed limit of 30 parallel playbacks).

There are several parameters to adjust the playback. These are grabbed on trigger and can not influence a runnging playback.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

ARGUMENT:: audioBuf
Buffer with signal data from RTWaveSetAnalysis.

ARGUMENT:: wsBuf
Buffer with waveset data from RTWaveSetAnalysis.

ARGUMENT:: repeats
Number of playback repetitions of the waveset group.

ARGUMENT:: numWS
Number of wavesets starting from the given index forward that well be combined to a group and played.

ARGUMENT:: xingIdx
Index of the (first) waveset to be played. Depending on numWS the following wavesets will be added to a group.

ARGUMENT:: trig
Trigger to start the playback of the defined wavesets. There are up to 30 parallel playbacks possible.

ARGUMENT:: idxOffset
(describe argument here)

ARGUMENT:: rate
Playback rate i.e. 1=normal playback, 1.5 = faster, -0.275 = slowly backwards.
(So far implemented without interpolation, just repeat/skip samples.)

returns:: Output is the playback signal.
